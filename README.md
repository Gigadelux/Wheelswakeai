Tools that I used:

1. TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and resources for building and deploying machine learning models. TensorFlow is widely used for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and deep learning.

2. Kotlin Framework: Kotlin is a modern programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is fully interoperable with Java and offers a more concise and expressive syntax. The Kotlin Framework provides a set of libraries and tools that enhance the development experience when using Kotlin. It includes features like coroutines for asynchronous programming, extension functions for adding functionality to existing classes, and null safety to prevent null pointer exceptions.

By leveraging TensorFlow and the Kotlin Framework, developers can build powerful and efficient machine learning applications with ease. These tools offer a wide range of capabilities and support, making them popular choices in the software development community.
